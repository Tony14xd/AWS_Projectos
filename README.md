Cloud Computing has been constantly evolcing and changing throughout the years since its emergence around 2006. It has without a doubt changed how we think about, use, and administer cloud services. Cloud Computing is the on-demand availability of computing services especially servers, data storage, networking and computing power without direct active management by the user. This is further facilitated by the renting of resources from another company's computers where you only pay for what you use as you go.

I believe MultiCloud has become a more attractive approach in the recent years as you can leverage the best services from multiple cloud providers for a given task. This includes Amazon Web Services (AWS), which offers many services in cloud computing and offers flexible, reliable, scalable, easy-to-use and cost-effective cloud computing solutions that includes a mixture of infrastructure as a service, platform as a service and software as a service offerings. Other major provides include Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, Google Cloud and Azure.

This repository will demonstrate the potential of MultiCloud and my hands on experience with it where I hope to bring that knowledge to a producton environment and to excel my experience related to working with not only AWS products and services, but to the broad range of cloud providers to be future references for me as a junior Cloud Engineer.
